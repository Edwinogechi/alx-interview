Project Name: 0x08-making_change

Description:
This project, "0x08-making_change", is a Python implementation aimed at solving the classic problem of making change for a given amount using the fewest number of coins possible. The project provides a function that takes in an amount and a list of coin denominations, then returns the minimum number of coins required to make change for that amount.

Usage:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x08-making_change.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd 0x08-making_change
Import the making_change function into your Python script:
python
Copy code
from making_change import making_change
Use the making_change function to find the minimum number of coins required to make change:
python
Copy code
coins = [1, 5, 10, 25]  # Example list of coin denominations
amount = 36              # Example amount to make change for
min_coins = making_change(amount, coins)
print("Minimum number of coins required:", min_coins)
This will output:
swift
Copy code
Minimum number of coins required: 3
Functionality:
The making_change function takes two arguments:

amount: The amount for which change needs to be made.
coins: A list of coin denominations available.
The function returns an integer representing the minimum number of coins required to make change for the given amount. If it's impossible to make exact change with the provided coin denominations, the function returns -1.

Example:

Input:
makefile
Copy code
amount = 36
coins = [1, 5, 10, 25]
Output:
Copy code
3
