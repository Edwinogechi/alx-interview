Project Name: 0x02-minimum_operations

Description:
This project aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to convert a number to 1 using a specific set of operations. The operations allowed are:

Subtract 1 from the number.
If the number is divisible by 2, divide it by 2.
If the number is divisible by 3, divide it by 3.
Usage:
To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Edwinogechi/0x02-minimum_operations.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd 0x02-minimum_operations
Run the main script: python minimum_operations.py
Input:
The input to the program is a positive integer, N.

Output:
The output of the program is the minimum number of operations required to convert N to 1.

Example:

vbnet
Copy code
Input: 10
Output: 3
Explanation: 10 can be converted to 1 by subtracting 1 three times (10 -> 9 -> 3 -> 1).

Tasks
0. Minimum Operations
mandatory
In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

Prototype: def minOperations(n)
Returns an integer
If n is impossible to achieve, return 0
Example:

n = 9

H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

Number of operations: 6
